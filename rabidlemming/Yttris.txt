[BOOK b_yttrium_hammer 1]
The legend of the 
Yttrium Enchanting
Hammer dates back 
before time itself.
Before most inhabited
the planet a race of
wizards,also known as
the Yttri Wizards

[BOOK b_yttrium_hammer 2]
dominated the planet.
This race of wizards
was very powerful
and had very evil 
souls. They used
thier magical powers
for any type of
personal gain.

[BOOK b_yttrium_hammer 3]
Out of the resources
of the planet they
made the Enchanting 
Hammer. It is said
that this item was the 
key to thier power.
When used it made 
them invulnerable to

[BOOK b_yttrium_hammer 4]
everything. When the
other races began to
come about, they
realized what kind of
power they had but 
didn't know how. All
of the races realized
that if this race ruled

[BOOK b_yttrium_hammer 5]
the planet that it 
would be filled with
pure hatred, so they 
joined together to
defeat these wizards.
It took them one
hundred years of
death and bloodshed to

[BOOK b_yttrium_hammer 6]
realize that thier 
power lays within the
hammer. They then 
devised a plan to
retrieve the hammers 
from them. Once
accomplished they
banished the race to a

[BOOK b_yttrium_hammer 7]
magically enclosed
tower where they
remain to this day.
Apparently they have
tried to recreate thier
beloved hammer out of
materials from the 
planet but to thier

[BOOK b_yttrium_hammer 8]
dismay it is not as
powerful as the 
original. To the other 
races of the world it
is still a treasured
item used to increase
thier armor to the 
sacred level.

[BOOK b_yttrium_hammer 9]
It is said that they are 
still trapped in that 
legendary tower in the
North Lands and that
the Yttri Warlocks
hold the Enchanted
Hammer.
